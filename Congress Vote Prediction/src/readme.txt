- Pioneer Valley is beautiful.\
- I have implemented both the NBC and Decision Tree. For NBC, I use Laplace add-1 smoothing and Logarithm to deal with precision and unappeared votes. I use all the voting options including Nay, Yea, Not Voting, Not Present, except for "blank" because I thought that it is a little confused since "blank" didn't give much information. For Decision Tree, I also used all the votes available in the training and testing file.\
